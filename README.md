### Polling / Voting app

< p> This is a voting platform that is used to vote. I designed it to be more practical in an organization wishing to conduct elections with no intentions of biasness</p>


<p> Candidates to be chosen can be entered into the system by the admin</p>
<p> Users can only vote once with no exception</p>

### Installation
1. Fork the project to your machine or editor
2. It is best practise to instanctiate a virtual env (pip install virtualenv) => (virtualenv venv) => (Source venve/Scripts/activate)
3. Install the requirements.txt file to get all the dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. To run the Django app = (python3 manage.py runserver)
